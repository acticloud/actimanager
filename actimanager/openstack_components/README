To enhance nova-scheduler's filter scheduler with ACTiCLOUD's filters and
weights the following steps are necessary:

- Copy weights/* in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/scheduler/weights
- Add the following lines in /etc/nova/nova.conf
  available_filters = nova.scheduler.filters.all_filters
  available_filters = nova.scheduler.filters.acticloud_filter.ActicloudFilter
  available_filters = nova.scheduler.filters.acticloud_lab_filter.ActicloudLabFilter

  enabled_filters = ActicloudLabFilter

  weight_classes = nova.scheduler.weights.all_weighers
  weight_classes = nova.scheduler.weights.acticloud_lab.ActicloudLabWeigher
- Restart nova-scheduler service
- Enjoy your new ACTiCLOUD-enabled Openstack nova-scheduler
